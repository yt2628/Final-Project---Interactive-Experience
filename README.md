# Final Project - Interactive Experience

This program is designed as a shared information webpage where a group of people with shared access can learn about a certain topic and make contributions. The topic is baking, but it can also be about anything that has structured sub-topics. In this program, you can:
* click on the recipe title to see details
* add your own recipe in an organized way (there will be reminders if necessary information is missing)
* delete unwanted items
* restore all previously existed items when you accidentally delete something useful

This is a pretty simple program, but looking forward, I think it can be the startpoint of organizing and sharing information.
